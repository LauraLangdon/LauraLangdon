### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Laura, and I'm a Developer Advocate at Suborbital Software Systems, where I manage documentation and participate in outreach activities, especially around the intersections of data science, Python, and extensibility. Previously a math lecturer at CSU East Bay, I'm devoted to issues in pedagogy, neurodivergence, and social responsibility in tech. In my free time, I enjoy recreational research and optimizing all the things.
